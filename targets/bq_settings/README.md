# BQ Settings

## What does this target do?

This is a test target that will be used for experiementing and testing the
logic for getting the settings for the BQ chip from CANopen and storing those
settings into EEPROM. Those settings can then be extracted from EEPROM and
sent to the BQ chip over I2C.
